# GEOL0069_Week4

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The task for the week 4 assignment in GEOL0069 Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation is to use unsupervised learning methods for altimetry classification and in particular, distinguishing between sea ice and leads in Sentinel-3 altimetry datasets. This builds on the notebook called Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_Michel.ipynb

### Prerequisites

The following software needs to be installed to run the code.
* Using pip install:
  ```sh
  !pip install netCDF4
  ```
  ```sh
  !pip install basemap
  ```
  ```sh
  !pip install cartopy
  ```

## Context

One of the main aims of the Sentinel-3 mission is to measure sea surface topography, with applications to the study of sea level, sea-ice and wind speed over the ocean surface, as well as ocean currents, waves, eddies and tides.
